## Description
Every year, we make resolutions to be healthier and to better our fitness goals only to find them broken time and time again. 
GETfit is a fitness application that allows users to create their very own fitness goal, plan workouts, as well 
as get workout recommendations from our super intelligent virtual fitness trainer, Waldo. Users are also able 
to track their workouts and view a graph of their performance over time for different exercises.
